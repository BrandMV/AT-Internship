Well motivation is something that i consider all of us gotta have in order to continue doing whatever we wanna do everyday,
without motivation we hardly go out of bed and we barely do, well, the things we gotta do. right?

Fortunately, i have abundant sources of motivation which are my family, my personal goals, fiernds and the continuous work to be a better person not just today, but everyday. For instance IÂ´ll just mention three of those sources of motivation as well as you can see in my presentation, well, my inphographics

Why my family motivates me? I think our family is fundamental in our lives, they play a vital role for motivating me during my highs and lows,
They always provide the things that I need when I need 'em and im not talking bout material stuff i mean support, love and tah kind of stuff that always
replenishes my positivity and optimism.

Then I have my personal goals, and i mean what are we without dreams, without goals? I have very clear goals that make me wake up evryday, to do my best effort 
to reach those goals. And also I see goals as a kind of challenge and be challenged by them is motivational cause I keep myself motivated with positive thoughts which make me optimistic and ready to chase my dreams and goals.

Finally I wrote learn new things. An yeah, learning new things everyday is a kind of motivation to me since we are learngin new stuff every single day of our lifes. Learnign keeps my mind focused in all that I can reach and of course thats  a source of motivation because always is exciting to learn bew things 

And well these where some sources of motivation to me
